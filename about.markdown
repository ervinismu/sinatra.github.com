About
=====

Sinatra was designed and developed by __Blake Mizerany__ (bmizerany) in
California.

Sinatra would not have been possible without strong company backing.
In the past, financial and emotional support have been provided mainly by
[Heroku](https://heroku.com), [GitHub](https://github.com) and
[Engine Yard](https://www.engineyard.com/), and is now taken care of by
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/).

Special thanks to the following extraordinary individuals, without whom
Sinatra would not be possible:

  whitespace errors __60d5006__

  deserves a web-framework named after him.
