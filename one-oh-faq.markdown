Sinatra 1.0 Frequently Asked Questions
======================================

Sinatra is going 1.0. Here are some things you should know:

## Is Sinatra 1.0 a rewrite / major conceptual overhaul?

No. Sinatra 1.0 is very much the same codebase as the current stable
0.9 release (0.9.6). The largest changes are internal - we're dropping
the backward compatibility module and test suite that's been
maintained since the 0.3 release. The majority of obsoleted features
are simple class/method name changes that have been documented for
some time. Very few features have been removed in their entirety.

Some [new features][ch] have been introduced.

## Will my existing Sinatra app work with 1.0? How can I check?

Maybe.

If you've kept up with deprecations and use officially documented
features, your app should be fine under Sinatra 1.0.

The latest Sinatra 0.9.x release (0.9.6 at time of writing) includes
comprehensive deprecation warnings for all incompatibilities introduced
in Sinatra 1.0. Run your test suite and app under 0.9.6 and watch for
warnings on standard error. When no more deprecation warnings remain,
upgrade your staging environment to Sinatra 1.0 and verify that stuff
works.

## Can I install and run under Sinatra 1.0 today?

**YES!** Install the latest 1.0 release with:

    gem install sinatra

Alternatively, you can grab a clone of the `master` branch:

    git clone git://github.com/sinatra/sinatra.git
    RUBYLIB="$(pwd)/sinatra/lib:$RUBYLIB"

## What incompatibilities are being introduced in Sinatra 1.0?

The following is a comprehensive list of features obsoleted in the
1.0 release. All of these have been deprecated for some time:

 * The `sinatra/test` library is obsolete. This includes the `Sinatra::Test`
   module, the `Sinatra::TestHarness` class, and the `get_it`, `post_it`,
   `put_it`, `delete_it`, and `head_it` helper methods. The
   [`Rack::Test` library](https://gitrdoc.com/brynary/rack-test) should
   be used instead.

 * Test framework specific libraries (`sinatra/test/spec`,
   `sinatra/test/bacon`,`sinatra/test/rspec`, etc.) are obsolete. See
   [Testing Sinatra](https://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html)
   for instructions on setting up a testing environment under each of
   these frameworks.

 * `Sinatra::Default` is obsolete; use `Sinatra::Base` instead.
   `Sinatra::Base` acts more like `Sinatra::Default` in 1.0. For
   example, static files and error handlers are enabled by default in
   all environment and classy development error pages are enabled in
   development environments.

 * Auto-requiring template libraries in the `erb`, `builder`, `haml`,
   and `sass` methods is obsolete due to thread-safety issues. You must
   require the template libraries explicitly in your app.

 * The `:views_directory` option to rendering methods is obsolete; use
   `:views` instead.

 * The `:haml` and `:sass` options to rendering methods are obsolete.
   Template engine options should be passed in the second Hash argument
   instead.

 * The `media_type` helper method is obsolete. Use `mime_type` instead.

 * The `mime` main and class method is obsolete. Use `mime_type` instead.

 * The request-level `send_data` method is no longer supported.

 * The `Sinatra::Event` and `Sinatra::EventContext` classes are no longer
   supported. This may effect extensions written for versions prior to 0.9.2.
   See [Writing Sinatra Extensions](https://www.sinatrarb.com/extensions.html)
   for the officially supported extensions API.

 * The `set_option` and `set_options` methods are obsolete; use `set`
   instead.

 * The `:env` setting (`settings.env`) is obsolete; use `:environment`
   instead.

 * The request level `stop` method is obsolete; use `halt` instead.

 * The request level `entity_tag` method is obsolete; use `etag`
   instead.

 * The request level `headers` method (HTTP response headers) is obsolete;
   use `response['Header-Name']` instead.

 * `Sinatra.application` is obsolete; use `Sinatra::Application` instead.

 * Using `Sinatra.application = nil` to reset an application is obsolete.
   This should no longer be necessary.

 * Using `Sinatra.default_options` to set base configuration items is
   obsolete; use `Sinatra::Base.set(key, value)` instead.

 * The `Sinatra::ServerError` exception is obsolete. All exceptions raised
   within a request are now treated as internal server errors and result in
   a 500 response status.

## What about new features?

See the [CHANGES][ch] file for a list of features added in the 1.0
release. There's also a comprehensive diff of all changes [between the
0.9.x and 1.0 releases][cv].

Lastly, the [1.0 Lighthouse milestone page][li] includes 80 tickets with
details on various features and bug fixes.

## How will versions be handled in the 1.x series?

We've adopted the [Semantic Versioning Model](https://semver.org/).
All 1.x releases will be backward compatible with the initial
1.0 release.

(This is one of the reasons we've waited so long to do an official 1.0
release. We're required not to break anything shipped in 1.0 for a very
long time, so interfaces we don't like require considerable scrutiny.)

## Will the 0.9.x series continue to be maintained?

Yes. There will be additional Sinatra 0.9.x releases for security
issues or major defects. No new features will be added to the 0.9.x
series.

The 0.9.x series will be maintained for as long as people use it.

## How can I pin my app to 0.9.x to avoid upgrading to 1.0?

You shouldn't have to do anything if you bundle/vendor sinatra with your
app. Just make sure you're pulling from the `0.9.x` branch or vendoring an
`0.9.x` gem.

If you use Rubygems, there's a very real possibility that Sinatra will
be upgraded to 1.0 on your system. You can force your apps to use an 0.9.x
version with:

    gem 'sinatra', '< 1.0'
